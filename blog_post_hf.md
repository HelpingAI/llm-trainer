# Making LLM Training Accessible to Everyone: A Complete Framework for Training Language Models from Scratch

*Train your own Large Language Model without the complexity - whether you have a GPU or just a CPU*

---

## Introduction

Training Large Language Models has traditionally been the exclusive domain of large tech companies with massive computational resources. But what if we told you that you could train your own LLM from scratch using just your laptop's CPU? Or seamlessly scale up to distributed GPU training when you're ready?

Today, we're excited to introduce **LLM Trainer** - a comprehensive, educational framework designed to make LLM training accessible to everyone, from curious beginners to experienced researchers. Unlike other training frameworks that assume extensive machine learning expertise, LLM Trainer is built with the philosophy that **anyone should be able to train their own language model**.

## Why Another LLM Training Framework?

The existing landscape of LLM training tools often falls into two categories:
1. **High-level APIs** that hide the implementation details, making it hard to learn and customize
2. **Low-level frameworks** that require deep expertise in distributed computing, optimization, and model architecture

LLM Trainer bridges this gap by providing:

- üéì **Educational transparency**: Every component is implemented from scratch with clear, well-documented code
- üíª **CPU-first approach**: Start training immediately, no GPU required
- üîß **Full customization**: Understand and modify every aspect of your model
- üìà **Seamless scaling**: Move from CPU to GPU to distributed training without code changes
- ü§ù **HuggingFace integration**: Compatible with existing tokenizers and models

## Getting Started: Your First Language Model in Minutes

Let's walk through training your first language model. We'll start with CPU training to show just how accessible this can be.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelpingAI/llm-trainer.git
cd llm-trainer
pip install -e .
```

### Option 1: Train on CPU (No GPU Required!)

```python
from llm_trainer.config import ModelConfig, TrainingConfig, DataConfig
from llm_trainer.models import TransformerLM
from llm_trainer.tokenizer import BPETokenizer
from llm_trainer.training import Trainer

# Create and train a tokenizer
tokenizer = BPETokenizer()
tokenizer.train_from_dataset(
    dataset_name="wikitext",
    dataset_config="wikitext-2-raw-v1",
    vocab_size=32000
)

# Configure a small model optimized for CPU
model_config = ModelConfig(
    vocab_size=tokenizer.vocab_size,
    d_model=256,      # Small for CPU efficiency
    n_heads=4,        # Fewer attention heads
    n_layers=4,       # Fewer layers
    max_seq_len=512   # Shorter sequences
)

# CPU-optimized training configuration
training_config = TrainingConfig(
    batch_size=2,                    # Small batch size
    learning_rate=8e-4,              # Slightly higher LR
    num_epochs=5,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,   # Simulate larger batches
    use_amp=False,                   # No mixed precision on CPU
    device="cpu"
)

# Train the model
model = TransformerLM(model_config)
trainer = Trainer(model, tokenizer, training_config)

# Configure data
data_config = DataConfig(
    dataset_name="wikitext",
    dataset_config="wikitext-2-raw-v1",
    max_length=512
)

trainer.train_from_config(model_config, data_config)
```

### Option 2: Use Pre-configured Settings

For even simpler setup, use our pre-configured YAML files:

```bash
# CPU training (perfect for learning)
python scripts/train.py --config configs/cpu_small_model.yaml --output_dir ./my_first_llm

# GPU training (when you're ready to scale)
python scripts/train.py --config configs/small_model.yaml --output_dir ./my_gpu_llm
```

## What Makes This Framework Special?

### 1. Built-in Tokenizer Implementation

Most frameworks assume you'll bring your own tokenizer. We include three full implementations:

- **BPE Tokenizer**: Complete Byte Pair Encoding with Unicode and emoji support
- **WordPiece Tokenizer**: BERT-style tokenization with likelihood-based merging  
- **HuggingFace Integration**: Use any existing tokenizer seamlessly

```python
# Train your own BPE tokenizer
tokenizer = BPETokenizer()
tokenizer.train_from_dataset("wikitext", "wikitext-2-raw-v1", vocab_size=32000)

# Or use a pre-trained tokenizer
from llm_trainer.tokenizer import HFTokenizerWrapper
hf_tokenizer = HFTokenizerWrapper("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2")
```

### 2. Transformer Architecture from Scratch

Unlike frameworks that wrap existing implementations, every component is built from the ground up:

```python
# Complete transformer implementation with:
class TransformerLM(BaseLanguageModel):
    def __init__(self, config):
        # Multi-head attention with causal masking
        # Position-wise feed-forward networks
        # Sinusoidal or learned positional embeddings
        # Pre/post-norm layer normalization
        # Configurable activation functions (GELU, ReLU, SiLU)
```

You can examine, modify, and learn from every line of code.

### 3. CPU-First Training Philosophy

We believe learning shouldn't require expensive hardware. Our CPU configurations are carefully optimized:

```yaml
# configs/cpu_small_model.yaml
device: "cpu"
model:
  d_model: 256
  n_heads: 4
  n_layers: 4
  
training:
  batch_size: 2
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 8  # Effective batch size: 16
  use_amp: false                  # No mixed precision on CPU
  dataloader_num_workers: 2       # Optimized for CPU
```

### 4. Seamless Scaling Path

When you're ready to scale up, simply change your configuration:

```python
# Scale to GPU
training_config = TrainingConfig(
    device="cuda",
    batch_size=16,
    use_amp=True,              # Enable mixed precision
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4
)

# Scale to distributed training
training_config = TrainingConfig(
    use_accelerate=True,       # HuggingFace Accelerate integration
    accelerate_mixed_precision="fp16"
)

# Add LoRA fine-tuning
training_config = TrainingConfig(
    use_peft=True,
    peft_type="lora",
    peft_r=8,
    peft_alpha=16
)
```

## Advanced Features for Production Use

### Modern Training Techniques

```python
# Gradient accumulation for large effective batch sizes
gradient_accumulation_steps=8

# Mixed precision training (GPU)
use_amp=True

# Gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
gradient_checkpointing=True

# EMA (Exponential Moving Average) for stable training
use_ema=True
ema_decay=0.999
```

### Multiple Generation Strategies

```python
from llm_trainer.utils.generation import TextGenerator, GenerationConfig

generator = TextGenerator(model, tokenizer)

# Nucleus sampling
config = GenerationConfig(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.9, do_sample=True)

# Beam search
config = GenerationConfig(num_beams=5, temperature=1.0)

# Top-k sampling  
config = GenerationConfig(top_k=50, temperature=0.7)

generated = generator.generate("The future of AI is", config)
```

### Comprehensive Monitoring

## HuggingFace Ecosystem Integration

While we implement everything from scratch for educational purposes, we seamlessly integrate with the HuggingFace ecosystem:

### Tokenizers

```python
# Use any HuggingFace tokenizer
tokenizer = HFTokenizerWrapper("microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")

# Or train your own and save in HF format
bpe_tokenizer = BPETokenizer()
bpe_tokenizer.train_from_dataset("your_dataset", vocab_size=50000)
bpe_tokenizer.save_pretrained("./my_tokenizer")  # HF-compatible format
```

### Models

```python
# Wrap HuggingFace models for training
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel
hf_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Train with our framework
trainer = Trainer(hf_model, tokenizer, config)
```

### Datasets

```python
# Direct integration with HuggingFace datasets
data_config = DataConfig(
    dataset_name="HuggingFaceTB/cosmopedia-20k",
    text_column="text",
    max_length=1024
)
```
